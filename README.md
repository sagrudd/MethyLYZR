# MethyLYZR


MethyLYZR is a Naïve Bayesian framework for rapid brain tumor classification from sparse epigenomic data. 

This repository provides code to apply the model and instructions on how to set it up with a pre-trained Naïve Bayes model for classification of brain tumor samples from sparse methylation data into 91 CNS tumor classes defined by Capper et al. (2018) and 3 metastases classes (i.e., from breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma).

Please refer to our publication for detailed information: [Rapid brain tumor classification from sparse epigenomic data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03435-3).

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

`MethyLYZR.py` requires a 'standard' personal computer with minimum 4 GB RAM or a compute server. While `MethyLYZR.py` does not utilize parallel processing and can technically run on systems with a single-core CPU, we recommend a minimum of a dual-core processor to ensure the system remains responsive for multitasking. When working with large datasets, additional memory is advisable. The runtimes stated below are generated using a computer (Apple iMac) with 64 GB RAM, 10 cores@3 GHz.

### Software Requirements

#### OS Requirements

The code has been tested on the following systems:

- macOS 13.2.1
- Internal Linux distribution

#### Python Dependencies

The Python package dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.



## Installation Guide

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure that **Python 3.5 or higher** is installed. The code was developed and tested using Python version 3.7.11.

### Setting Up the Environment

Follow these steps to set up an environment with all required Python packages:

1. Create a virtual environment for isolation of the dependencies
  ``` bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

2. Activate the environment
  ``` bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file
  ``` bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Data Requirements

Download the required datasets from [here](https://nc.molgen.mpg.de/cloud/index.php/s/sJJds3gfsmba5K2). Ensure that the files are stored in the `/model` folder before running the model. 

## Recommended Preprocessing

#### Basecalling of Raw Nanopore signals
First, the raw Nanopore signals should be processed into bases using the dorado basecall server from ONT (https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado/) implemented in the sequencing software MinKnow, using the high-accuracy basecalling model with 5mC modifications (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5mc_cg_hac.cfg). 

The obtained reads should then be mapped to human reference genome GRCH38.p13 using, e.g., `minimap2`, and saved into BAM files. Information on modified bases should use the **MM and ML tags** defined in the Sequence Alignment/Map Optional Fields Specification.

#### Processing of BAM files (bam2feather.py)
The extraction of methylation values from the BAM files into the required file format can be done using the provided Python script `bam2feather.py`. In short, the script first filters for primary alignments with a minimal mapping quality of 10, as reported by `minimap2`. Positions are further filtered on loci corresponding to a genomic position on the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip. The per read and CpG methylation probability is calculated using the SAM MM and ML tags. The output is written to disk as a feather file in the format required for MethyLYZR prediction (see below).

:warning: Note: When intending to filter methylation calls by read start times, it is crucial to verify the accuracy of the read start times as provided by the basecaller. We have observed that discrepancies in software versions can lead to inaccuracies in the reconstructed timing of base calls. Therefore, we strongly advise a **thorough validation of read start times** against your basecalling software's output to ensure the reliability of methylation timing analysis. 

###### Input arguments for bam2feather.py

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| -i, --inputs | directory with BAM files (required)  |
| -s, --sample | sample (file) name (required)  |
| -o, --output | output directory (required) |
| --sites | file with CpG site annotation in BED format (required) |
| -r, --recursive | recursive monitor subdirectories (default: False, action: store_true) |
| --io_threads | number of threads used for io-handling (default: 2) |
| --methylation_threads | number of threads used for methylation data extraction (default: 4) |
| --filter | string (present in the path) for filtering on barcodes |


###### An example run of the bam2feather.py script:
```bash
bam2feather.py -i input_dir_bams -s sample1 -r --sites data/EPIC_CpGannotation.bed -o output_dir --methylation_threads 24 --io_threads 8
```

###### Output Feather table format

The `bam2feather.py` script outputs a **feather file**, in the following format:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| epic_id | EPIC array probe ID associated with CpG site  |
| methylation | methylation probability [0,1]  |
| scores_per_read | number of measurements (covered by reference) on same read |
| read_no | read number |
| binary_methylation | 0 if methylation < 0.8, else 1 |
| read_id | read identifier |
| pct_identity | percent read identity to reference  |
| start_time | time in seconds after start of sequencing |
| run_id | sequencing run identifier |

:bulb: **This feather file format is the required input format for `MethyLYZR.py`.**

## Running MethyLYZR for Tumor Classification (MethyLYZR.py)

To classify a given Nanopore sample using the pre-trained Naïve Bayes model for CNS tumor class prediction, use: 

```bash
python MethyLYZR.py -i sampleX.feather -s sampleX -o results
```

The default command runs the original MethyLYZR v1.0.0 scoring behavior. The 2026 calibrated update can be enabled explicitly:

```bash
python MethyLYZR.py -i sampleX.feather -s sampleX -o results --mode optimized --calibrate
```

#### Pre-trained Model
Components making up the trained Naïve Bayes model stored in `model/`:
- centroids (`betas_mean.feather`)
    - mean methylation profiles per class
- feature weights (`W_RELIEF.feather`)
    - class-specific weights derived from ReliefF-based method
- class priors (`class_priors.csv`)
    - prior probabilities per class derived from relative frequencies in training data

This model encompasses 91 CNS + 3 metastasis classes.

#### Input Arguments for MethyLYZR.py

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| -i, --inputs | methylation data input feather file (required)  |
| -s, --sample | sample name (required)  |
| -o, --output | output directory (required) |
| -c, --centroids | directory of pre-trained class centroids (default: 'model/betas_mean.feather')  |
| -w, --weights | directory of pre-trained class centroids (default: 'model/W_RELIEF.feather')  |
| -p, --priors | directory of pre-trained class priors (default: 'model/class_priors.csv')  |
| --minNoise | minimum noise value added to centroids (default: 0.05) |
| --methLowerBound | lower bound for calling methylated loci (default: 0.8) |
| --methUpperBound | upper bound for calling unmethylated loci (default: 0.2) |
| --mode | prediction mode: `original` for MethyLYZR v1.0.0 behavior, or `optimized` for MethyLYZR2026 adaptive RELIEF weighting and basecount (default: `original`) |
| --calibrate | enable adaptive temperature scaling of posterior probabilities (default: off) |
| --T_base | base temperature used for calibration (default: 3.2) |
| --N_ref | reference CpG count where `T = T_base` (default: 7500) |
| --alpha_T | exponent for CpG-dependent adaptive temperature (default: 0.5) |



#### MethyLYZR2026 Optimized and Calibrated Mode

MethyLYZR2026 mode keeps the original model files unchanged and adjusts how the existing RELIEF weights and posterior probabilities are used at prediction time.

- `--mode optimized` changes the RELIEF weight transformation from `exp(-W)` to `exp(alpha * W)`, where `alpha` is interpolated from the number of observed CpGs.
- `--mode optimized` also replaces the fixed `BASECOUNT = 300` normalization with `684.6 + 0.0759 * n_cpg`.
- `--calibrate` applies post-hoc adaptive temperature scaling: `T(n) = T_base * (N_ref / n_cpg) ** alpha_T`.
- Calibration preserves the top predicted class, but softens the posterior probabilities. This can make low-coverage predictions less likely to exceed the 0.6 high-certainty threshold.
- Optimized and calibrated runs use suffixed output filenames such as `MethyLYZR_2026_sampleX.csv`, `MethyLYZR_cal_sampleX.csv`, or `MethyLYZR_2026cal_sampleX.csv`.



#### What it does
1.  reads the pre-trained model (centroids + feature weights + class priors)
2.  loads sample from corresponding feather file
3.  preprocesses the methylation measurements
    - filtering for (methylation probability < methUpperBound) OR (methylation probabilty > methLowerBound)
    - filtering for number of features per read <= 10
    - calculating noise
    - calculating read weights
    - binarize methylation probabilities
4.  predicts posterior probabilities for all 94 classes using Naïve Bayesian framework
5.  outputs
    - a ranked list with the posterior probabilites for all classes as a CSV
    - a barplot showing the posterior probabilities of the top 5 hits as a PDF

#### Posterior Probabilities

The probabilities of predictions output by `MethyLYZR.py` range from 0 to 1 and reflect the certainty of the prediction.

- Scores > 0.6: Predictions with probabilities above 0.6 can be regarded as **high-certainty predictions**.

- Scores <= 0.6: Predictions with scores below 0.6 are considered to have **lower certainty**. These results suggest that the model has lower confidence in the prediction, and they should be treated accordingly.



### Demo


This demo illustrates how to use MethyLYZR to process sample data and generate output files. We use `IEG14_4d93b1bb47f2b6315c552126160915afc2a89ca7.feather` as input to produce a CSV table of the predictions and a PDF with visualized top 5 classes.


0. Preprocess the input data using `bam2feather.py`
  ```bash
  python bam2feather.py -i IEG14_HG38/ -s IEG14_4d93b1bb47f2b6315c552126160915afc2a89ca7 -r --sites data/EPIC_CpGannotation.bed -o demo_outputs --methylation_threads 24 --io_threads 8

  ```

Follow these steps to replicate the demo:

1.  Run `MethyLYZR.py` on the preprocessed data for test sample IEG14 (:hourglass_flowing_sand: Runtime: 59.7 seconds)

  ```bash
  python MethyLYZR.py -i data/ONT_15min_runs/IEG14_4d93b1bb47f2b6315c552126160915afc2a89ca7.feather -s IEG14 -o results \
  -c model/betas_mean.feather -w model/W_RELIEF.feather -p model/class_priors.csv --minNoise 0.05 --methLowerBound 0.8 --methUpperBound 0.2
  ```

  This will print the following log to the command line

## Data Availability 

[This dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13236096) provides methylation data from ONT (R9 and R10) and PacBio sequencing, stored in **feather format**. These data were generated from brain tumor biopsies and can be used **directly as input** for `MethyLYZR.py`, or filtered by timestamps to **post-hoc simulate shorter sequencing runs**.  

## Python Package Build

MethyLYZR can be built as a source distribution and pure-Python wheel for deployment testing:

```bash
python -m pip install build
python -m build
```

The build writes artifacts to `dist/`:

- `methylyzr-<version>.tar.gz`
- `methylyzr-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`

Install the wheel into a target environment with:

```bash
python -m pip install dist/methylyzr-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

The wheel provides the `methylzyr` console command for tumor classification and installs the BAM preprocessing scripts `bam2feather.py` and `live_classifier.py`. The pre-trained model files remain external runtime inputs and should be supplied with `-c`, `-w`, and `-p` when they are not present in the working directory.
